# Overview of what we are going to do:
We will create word embeddings for all unique words in a wikipedia article.

# Code Files in our project:
1. Corpus_Preprocessing.py : This is a script that applies pre-processing on the corpus text and creates vocabulary
2. Method_Definitions.py : Itâ€™s a module that contains method definitions for tasks other than performing gradient descent.
3. SGD_nn.py : This contains method that will perform gradient descent using PyTorch neural network
4. app.py : Main execution script for skip-gram process, where all the methods are called
